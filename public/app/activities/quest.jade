h3 Team Adventure Challenge
p For those who want to test themselves and with a competitive nature, why not take part in a Team Adventure Challenge?  At the same time help raise funds for SOS NI, through team sponsorship. 

p Your team will set out to navigate a ‘macro’ based star orienteering course, facing obstacles, both mental and physical throughout the 10k route, to win points by either attaining an orienteering marker, or successfully completing a task.

p Tasks include: Field Archery, Tangram (Oriental Jigsaw), Open Canoeing, Dominoes (Numerical Puzzles), and Crazy Cycle.

p
  b The team who scores the highest wins… will you play smarter or harder?

  b Young people under the age of 17 should be accompanied by an adult; minimum age restriction of 11 years old is applicable for this event.
