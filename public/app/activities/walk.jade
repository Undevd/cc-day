    h3 Lakeside Stroll and Event Spectators
    p The relaxed lakeside walk circumnavigates Castlewellan Lake and provides good views of Slievenaslat and Castlewellan Castle, with excellent views across the lake and surrounding woodland. The trail passes close to the Ice House and the iconic Castle built in 1856.

    p This 3.9km walk is aimed at all abilities, including those with limited mobility.  Path surfaces are even and consistent throughout and the gradient is relatively flat, making this walk suitable for children in buggies. Dogs are also welcome, although please keep them on a lead.

    p Life staff will provide a verbal brief before setting off and a trail map to show the lakeside route as well as the location of the other facilities in the surrounding park (see ‘Other Facilities’ below).

    p There will be some volunteers around the trail so you are guaranteed to find your way back to the Grange Yard in time for lunch! To add a little bit of excitement to the walk, you will be asked to keep an eye out for some hidden jigsaw pieces on the journey… if you’re lucky enough to find one, bring it back to the Grange Yard for a surprise at the end of the day!
